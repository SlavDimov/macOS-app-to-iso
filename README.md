# macOS-app-to-iso

This is just a small script that will create a bootable hfs+ partitioned .iso file from a macOS.app file.

# Usage

To run the script simply type:
```
bash ./macOS-app-to-iso.sh macOS.app [ macOS.iso ]"
```

# Requirements

* macOS.app, downloaded from the App Store
* Installed macOS

**Note:**

This script uses proprietary Apple tools to create the .iso, therefore requires macOS to run. 

# Tests
